# How I Beat The Password Game

If you've been browsing on the Internet in the past few years, you might have come across "The Password Game". It's a broswer puzzle game created by Neal and released on 27 June, 2023. 
The premise of the game is simple, you have to create a password that complies with all the rules given. However, it is much more difficult than it seems. The game starts off with pretty standard rules that you would
expect in any other password policy but it quickly esclates into a wonderful chaotic mess. 

I first attempted the game about a year ago, but got stuck on Rule 24. After several attempts, I everntually gave up. That is until a month ago when I stumbled upon a video from EasySpeezy on YouTube explaining the strategies 
speedrunners use to beat the game in seconds. I learned about different strategies and resources that I can use to beat the game from this video. So, I finally decided to attempt to beat the game again, and this time,
I will beat the game in anyway I can.
