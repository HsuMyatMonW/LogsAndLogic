# How I Beat The Password Game

If you've been keeping up with the Internet for the past few years, chances are that you might have come across "[The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/)". It's a broswer puzzle game created by Neal Agarwal.

The premise of the game is simple: create a password that follows all the given rules. This may seem easy at first since the game starts off with pretty standard rules that you'd expect in a regular password policy, however, the rules become increasingly strange and complicated and everything quickly esclates into a wonderful chaotic mess. There are 35 rules in total that the password must comply with to pass.

The Password Game first came into my knowledge about a year ago and immediately piqued my interest. I attempted the game for myself but I only made it as far as Rule 24. Between the constant maintenance required for Rule 23 and the search for a suitable solution to Rule 24, I was unable to split my attention between the two. After several failed attempts, I eventually gave up. That was until a month ago, when I stumbled upon a [video](https://youtu.be/-osyW_rpoQs?si=ac6onb_5X4Ck7H-G) explaining the strategies and [resources](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12A2Og_CD6IMQMwbWyb3tLVW0AAmLHG7g/view?usp=drivesdk) that speedrunners use to beat the game in seconds. That's when I realised that I could follow some of these strategies to beat the game myself. So, I finally decided to attempt the game once again, but this time, I was determined to get to the finish line.
