# The Password Game

If you've been keeping up with the Internet for the past few years, chances are that you might have come across "[The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/)". It's a browser puzzle game created by Neal Agarwal.

The premise of the game is simple: create a password that follows all the given rules. This may seem easy at first since the game starts off with pretty standard rules that you'd expect in a regular password policy. However, the rules become increasingly strange and complicated as the game goes on, and everything quickly escalates into a wonderful chaotic mess.

The Password Game first came into my knowledge about a year ago and immediately piqued my interest. I played the game for myself, but I only made it to Rule 24 out of a total of 35 rules. Between the constant maintenance required for Rule 23 and the search for a suitable answer to Rule 24, I was unable to split my attention between the two. After several failed attempts, I eventually gave up. 

That was until a month ago, when I stumbled upon a [video](https://youtu.be/-osyW_rpoQs?si=ac6onb_5X4Ck7H-G) explaining the strategies and [resources](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12A2Og_CD6IMQMwbWyb3tLVW0AAmLHG7g/view?usp=drivesdk) that speedrunners use to beat the game in seconds. That's when I realised that I could follow some of these strategies to beat the game myself. So, I finally decided to attempt the game once again, but this time, I was determined to get to the finish line.

## Gameplay

The player is given an input text field with the prompt: "Please choose a password." Once the player starts typing a password, the game introduces the first password rule. When the player enters a password that complies with this rule, the game reveals the second rule, and so on.

To progress, the player must choose a password that satisfies the current rule as well as all previously introduced rules. At times, attempting to follow a new rule may cause the password to break a previous one. In such cases, the player must revise the password to meet all rules up to that point.

There are a total of 35 rules that the final password must satisfy.
