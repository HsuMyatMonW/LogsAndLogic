# Problem That Does Not Need Solving
Greetings! My name is Hsu, and I like solving problems. This repository is a collection of reports and challenge logs documenting the problems I have solved.

The name "Problem That Does Not Need Solving" is ironic because these are problems that didn’t need solving since they didn’t directly affect my life, but I solved them anyway. It serves as a reminder that while you can choose to skip many problems in life, doing so means missing out on opportunities to improve. If you don’t build the habit of systematically finding solutions to the problems that come your way, your skills may stagnate over time.
